This module will illustrate how to use Spring AOP concepts.

Spring AOP only supports method interception, and the weaving process is applied at Runtime.

The domain will be based on "Driving a Car" in the form of an interface called 'Car'.

The Aspect will document the process, what needs to happen, before and after the drive() method is invoked.
