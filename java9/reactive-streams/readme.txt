This module gives a overview of Java 9's java.util.concurrent.Flow class which defines 3 interfaces,
namely Publisher, Subscriber, Processor and Subscription.

The examples show how you create a subscriber instance which you subscribe to the publisher, and use
the subscription to control the flow of information in a push fashion.
